## RECOMMENDATIONS AND OBSERVATIONS for the next /openday_v03

* When a new user start the experiment, the labels for partcipants were wrong for
which is recommended to have a piece of paper to write down the participant number
which might be part of the general check list.
* It would be nice to program the robot with some voice commands while the user
is waiting for the sensors seeting up in ROS

---

This repository is aimed for those who want to learn more about the Human-Robot
Interaction Demo at the OpenDays at University of Birmingham. The demonstration
is about a human-humanoid dance interaction with a NAO humanoid robot. 
In the interaction, a person in a face-to-face interaction imitates 
what the robot does. Essentially users mirror or imitate 10 arm upper 
movements.

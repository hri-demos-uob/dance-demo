HRI DEMO FOR THE OPENDAY AT UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM
---

This repository is aimed to those who want to learn more about the Human-Robot
Interaction Demo at the OpenDays at University of Birmingham. Such demo is a
sort of a dance interaction with a NAO humanoid robot where an user 
in a face-to-face interaction imitates what the robot does. 
Esentially users mirror/imitate 10 arm upper movements.

In order to keep anonimalised the data from the users with NAO,
just the landmark and head pose and gaze eye estimation and internital sensor
time series are used for data analysis.
